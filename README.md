# Repo tree to host projects that can be delivered locally via an API.
Changes :
1. API - Flask framework ; TODO: add react or some sort of front-end face lift.
    - NBA : Selenium / BeautifulSoup / urllib (swapped out) : webscraper that (currently) retrieves daily matchups ; TODO: expand on what data to grab/scrape
        - https://github.com/ChidoNguyen/PythonProjects/tree/main/API/NBA
2. Created react tic-tac-toe mini project to get comfortable with various aspects of react.
3. Changing the API to use react to render pages , rather than flask (now only handles API end points)
4. Todo: mess with some css for ui improvement ; add "routing" to react app so parent API homepage can point to different projects
